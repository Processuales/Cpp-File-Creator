# Cpp-File-Creator
Ever wanted to create a c++ file that can create another c++ file, and that c++ file can create a python (or any other) file? Look no further!

How to use : 
1. Enter the path of the python file 
2. Enter a unique filename for the c++ file
3. You will get a c++ file and a executable, double click the executable to create the python file

You can also edit the code so it may work with different files, not just python!

First ever "big" project, so I hole you like it :)
